# Contributors
This application was created as a part of a homework assignment so the source code was provided by the Institution but the logic of the App was worked by [Maurya](https://github.com/maurya512). Anyone with a github account can fork the repo and work on it. I am open to suggestions to make this app more UI intuitive.
